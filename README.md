# Build Your Own Privacy Jenga Set

To get started, you'll need three main things to assemble your Privacy Jenga set:

## 1) Blocks
You’ll need a tumbling tower to play. Here’s how to get started:

- **Option 1 (recommended)** – Order a tumbling tower from [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CQR7M3JH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image).
- **Option 2** – Can’t get that tower? Create your own by color-coding the blocks with three severity levels.

## 2) Stickers
To customize your game pieces, print stickers using our template!

- **Download the file** – Grab the template we’ve provided.
- **Print onto sticker sheets** – Use [this sticker sheet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BBJLCP4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title), or choose your own method to print and apply.

## 3) Dice -or- Cards
You’ll need a way to determine the severity (mild, moderate, severe) for each move. Choose one method below — no need to use both!

- **Option 1: Dice** – 3D print your own dice with the three colors using our assets, or order a custom dice online. Want to contribute? Create a 3D printing file for the community!
- **Option 2: Cards** – Print our severity cards (mild, moderate, severe) on a business card sheet for easy use.
