# Build Your Own Privacy Jenga Set

Here’s what you need to assemble a **Privacy Jenga** set:

## 1) Blocks
You’ll need a tumbling tower to play.

- **Option 1 (recommended)** – Order a tumbling tower from [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CQR7M3JH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image).
- **Option 2** – Can’t get that tower? Create your own by color-coding the blocks for three severity levels.

## 2) Labels
Prepare your blocks by printing and applying some stickers using our template.

- **Download the file** – Grab the [template](https://github.com/dplusplus1024/bitcoin-jenga/tree/main/assets/labels) we’ve provided.
- **Print onto sticker sheets** – Use [this sticker sheet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BBJLCP4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title), or choose your own printing method.
- **Apply labels** - Place the labels onto the blocks, matching the severity levels with the appropriate block colors:
    - **Mild** (first column) – Apply to **cream-colored** blocks.
    - **Moderate** (second column) – Apply to **orange-red** blocks.
    - **Severe** (third column) – Apply to **crimson-red** blocks.

## 3) Dice or Cards
You’ll need a way to determine the severity (mild, moderate, severe) for each move. Choose one method below — no need to use both!

- **Option 1: Cards** – Print and cut our [severity cards](https://github.com/dplusplus1024/bitcoin-jenga/blob/main/assets/severity-cards.doc) (mild, moderate, severe). You can optionally purchase [these business card sheets](https://www.amazon.com/Avery-Printable-Business-Printers-Heavyweight/dp/B002NGML5G) for your convenience.
- **Option 2: Dice** – Order [custom dice online](https://www.boardgamesmaker.com/print/custom-round-dice-16mm.html) using [our assets](https://github.com/dplusplus1024/bitcoin-jenga/tree/main/assets/dice), or 3D print dice with a design of your own. Want to contribute? You could create a 3D printing file for the community!
